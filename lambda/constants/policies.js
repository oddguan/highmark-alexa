Highmark Health is partnering with industry-leading technology companies and other service
providers to create a remarkable digital member experience. Our goal is to enhance your health-related
journey and make your experience on our digital tools and channels more customized and applicable to
your specific needs. This collaborative effort (the “Program”) involves Highmark Health gathering,
utilizing, and sharing appropriate customer information with our business partners to help design,
implement, and manage innovative capabilities that enable our members to quickly access up to date
plan information and other details through a cloud-hosted digital member website, mobile app, and an
integrated conversational chatbot tool.
To offer this personalized experience, Highmark Health must collect, use, and disclose personal
information across our digital tools and channels. This information can include, among other things,
demographics such as your name and date of birth, contact information such as phone number,
address, and email address, details about receipt of healthcare services such as dates of service and
medical conditions and procedures, details about your insurance benefits such as policy number and
claims, and information about your activities on our digital tools and channels such as internet protocol
(IP) address, device identifier, and cookie ID (collectively, “Personal Information”). By studying the
ways in which you navigate through our digital tools and channels, we can continuously improve and
optimize the information and programs that match your needs and interests to deliver the right
information at the right time throughout your health care experience.
Highmark Health is collaborating with companies including Google on digital improvement
projects supporting the Program. Our collaborations allow us to offer capabilities such as real-time chat
sessions where users can ask questions on our member portal like “have I met my deductible this year”
and similar inquiries. These projects require that Highmark Health share your Personal Information with
its business partners (like Google) for product and solution development, testing, and refinement
purposes.
Highmark Health recognizes that its business partners may not be subject to the same range of
federal and/or state laws governing the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.
Nevertheless, we have taken a number of steps to ensure that your information is handled responsibly,
such as by maintaining a rigorous internal privacy and data ethics program, negotiating restrictive
contract terms with third party service providers, and seeking to obtain your affirmative authorization,
as applicable.
As an entity subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Highmark
Health must meet standards set by federal regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
Personal Information relating to your healthcare and payment for your care (“Protected Health
Information” or “PHI”). We are asking you to sign the below HIPAA Authorization to ensure we comply
with relevant legal requirements when collecting, using, and disclosing your PHI in connection with the
Program.
